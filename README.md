[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/pixop/video-compare)](https://github.com/pixop/video-compare/releases)

Split-screen video comparison tool written in C++14, utilizing FFmpeg libraries and SDL3. It provides
interactive navigation and playback controls, along with various analysis tools and customizable display options.

`video-compare` can be used to visually compare the impact of codecs, resizing algorithms, and other modifications
on two video files played in sync. The tool is versatile, allowing videos of differing resolutions, frame rates,
scanning methods, color formats, dynamic ranges, input protocols, container formats, codecs, or durations.

Thanks to FFmpeg's flexibility, `video-compare` is also capable of comparing images or image sequences.

## Usage

Launch using the operating system's DPI setting. Video pixels are doubled on devices like a Retina 5K display;
therefore, it is the preferred option for displaying HD 1080p videos on such screens:

    video-compare video1.mp4 video2.mp4

Allow high DPI mode on systems which supports that. Video pixels are displayed "1-to-1". Useful
for e.g. displaying UHD 4K video on a Retina 5K display:

    video-compare -d video1.mp4 video2.mp4

Increase bit depth to 10 bits per color component (8 bits is the default). Fidelity is increased while
performance takes a hit. Significantly reduces visible banding on systems with a higher grade display
and driver support for 30-bit color:

    video-compare -b video1.mp4 video2.mp4

Use a specific window size instead of deriving the window size from the video dimensions. The video
frame will be scaled to fit. If either width or height is left out, the missing value will be calculated
from the other specified dimension so that aspect ratio is maintained. Useful for downscaling high resolution
video onto a low resolution display:

    video-compare -w 1280x720 video1.mp4 video2.mp4

Size the window to fit the usable display bounds while maintaining the video's aspect ratio. This option adjusts
for elements like taskbars or OS menus. Ideal for maximizing the viewing area while keeping the video dimensions
proportional to the screen:

    video-compare -W video1.mp4 video2.mp4

Automatic in-buffer loop playback, triggered when the buffer fills or end-of-file is reached, streamlines
video analysis by eliminating the need for manual replay initiation (bidirectional "ping-pong" mode, `pp`, is
also available):

    video-compare -a on video1.mp4 video2.mp4

Shift the presentation time stamps of the right video instead of assuming the videos are aligned. A
positive amount has the effect of delaying the left video while negative values conversely delays the
right video. Useful when videos are slightly out of sync:

    video-compare -t 0.080 video1.mp4 video2.mp4

Display videos stacked vertically at full size without a slider (`hstack` for horizontal stacking is
also supported):

    video-compare -m vstack video1.mp4 video2.mp4

Preprocess one or both inputs via a list of FFmpeg video filters specified on the command line
(see [FFmpeg's video filters documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Video-Filters)).
The Swiss Army knife for cropping/padding (comparing videos with different aspect ratios),
adjusting colors, deinterlacing, denoising, speeding up/slowing down, etc.:

    video-compare -l crop=iw:ih-240 -r format=gray,pad=iw+320:ih:160:0 video1.mp4 video2.mp4

Select a demuxer that cannot be auto-detected (such as VapourSynth):

    video-compare --left-demuxer vapoursynth script.vpy video.mp4

Explicit decoder selection for the right video:

    video-compare --right-decoder h264_cuvid video1.mp4 video2.mp4

Set the same hardware acceleration type for both videos:

    video-compare --hwaccel cuda video1.mp4 video2.mp4

Set the hardware acceleration type for the left video only:

    video-compare --left-hwaccel videotoolbox video1.mp4 video2.mp4

By default, HDR videos are automatically color space converted to sRGB with an initial 500-nit peak light
level. This default can be overridden with a custom peak light level, such as 850 nits. The specified peak
light level is then dynamically adjusted during decoding based on any MaxCLL metadata:

    video-compare -R 850 sdr_video.mp4 hdr_video.mp4

Map a 500-nit peak light level HDR video for an sRGB SDR display, and adjust the tone of the SDR video
to simulate the relative light level difference between the two videos on an actual HDR display:

    video-compare -T rel -L 500 hdr_video.mp4 sdr_video.mp4

Perform simpler comparison of a video with itself using double underscore (`__`) as a placeholder. This
enables tasks such as comparing the video with a time-shifted version of itself or testing various sets
of filters, without the need to enter the same, potentially long path twice:

    video-compare some/very/long/and/complicated/video/path.mp4 __

Apply common filters to both videos and extend them with additional side-specific filters using the
placeholder resolution functionality. This structure also works for demuxer, decoder, and hardware
acceleration settings:

    video-compare -i yadif,hqdn3d -l setfield=bff,__ -r __,scale=iw/2:ih/2 video1.mp4 video2.mp4

The above features can be combined in any order, of course. Launch `video-compare` without any arguments to
see all supported options.

by moving the mouse while holding down the right button.

Left-click the mouse to perform a time seek based on the horizontal position of the
mouse cursor relative to the window width (the target position is shown in the lower
right corner).

**Hold** `Shift` while pressing `D` to decode and move to the next frame.

**Hold** `Ctrl` while time-shifting with `+`/`-` for faster increments/decrements of 10 frames
per keystroke. Similarly, **hold** `Alt` for even larger time-shifts of 100 frames.

Use `Ctrl+C` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+C` (macOS) to copy the current timestamp of the left video
to the clipboard, and `Ctrl+V` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+V` (macOS) to paste a timestamp from the
clipboard and seek to that position.

Use `Shift+F` to select a region; cutouts from both frames and their concatenation will be saved
as PNGs.

## Build

### Requirements

Requires FFmpeg headers and development libraries to be installed, along with SDL3 and
its TrueType font rendering add on (libsdl3_ttf).

On Debian GNU/Linux the required development packages can be installed via `apt`:

```sh
apt install libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavfilter-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev libsdl3-dev libsdl3-ttf-dev
```

### Instructions

Compile the source code via GNU Make:

```sh
make
```

The linked `video-compare` executable will be created in the soure code directory. To perform a system wide installation:

```sh
make install
```

Note that root privileges are required to perform this operation in most environments (hint: use e.g. `sudo`).

## Notes

1. Audio playback is not supported.

2. Keep time-shifts below a few seconds for the best experience.

3. Seeks require re-synchronization on the closest keyframe (i.e., I-frame).

## Practical tips

### Send To integration in Windows File Explorer

You can fire up the tool directly from the File Explorer when you don't need to specify
any other arguments than the inputs via Right click -> Send To -> video-compare.

Here is how this integration works:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8549626/166630445-c8c511b7-005f-48aa-83bc-0eb9676cfa2a.mp4

You can do that quickly by selecting two files, then right clicking any of them, pressing N (focuses se**n**d to),
then V (selects **v**ideo-compare).

To get video-compare to appear in the `Send To` field you will need to open the `send to` folder, which
you can access by typing `shell:sendto` in Run (Windows + R), then simply make a shortcut to `video-compare.exe`.

Thanks to [couleurm](https://github.com/couleurm) for the sharing this tip and creating the screen recording above.

### More frontend options for Windows users

For Windows users, the community has shared several frontend options to complement the command-line functionality:

1. **Beyond Compare** integration: Launch `video-compare` directly from the interface.

2. **Total Commander** integration: Add a toolbar button to open selected videos.

3. **[VideoCompareGUI](https://github.com/TetzkatLipHoka/VideoCompareGUI)**: A standalone graphical utility that simplifies launching `video-compare`.
